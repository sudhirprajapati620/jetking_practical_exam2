read the data from smart contract application binery interface and address, and more etc.

ABI
ABI is an interface between the front end and the back end of a Dapp. ABI contains information about the functions present in the smart contact along with their parameters and return type.

Address
Every account and smart contract in the Ethereum blockchain has an address. 
We need the address to locate the smart contract and interact with it.

for example.
